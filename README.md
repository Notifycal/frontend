## Requirements

- [NodeJS 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Getting Started

Getting started is a simple as cloning the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:Notifycal/frontend.git
```

Changing into the new directory

```
cd frontend
```

Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

Congrats! You're ready to starting working!

## Important Notes

1. [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) is included to encourage more isolated testing and allow for rapid development of demos and MVPs. However, please make note that, [due to a bug](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/1791), importing Faker from the main package (without a locale) will result in the entire Faker lib being imported causing bundle sizes to increase up to 2+ MB. Instead prefer [localized imports](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/localization.html#individual-localized-packages) as shown below.

   ```
   // import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
   import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en'; // prefer localization when possible
   ```

   The imported lib will instead be around 600 KB. Nonetheless, Faker should **NOT** be used in production and instead be limited to testing and demos.

2. [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) aren't necessarily made to work with each other. Buttons might behave incorrectly if their setups aren't 100% right. These are some links with info just in case it happens to us:

## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library and Vitest.

```
npm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute vitest:

```
npm run test:unit
```

If instead you are interested in coverage reporting, run:

```
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

All unit tests run in watch mode by default. If you'd like to disable watch mode, change the package.json test scripts with the following

before:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest src/",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest --coverage src/"
}
```

After:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest run src/",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest run --coverage src/"
}
```

**Note**: Faker is included to provide mock data. See the [Important Note](#important-note) section for crucial details regarding this package. Specifically, point 3.

## Creating a build

Creating a build is as easy as running:

```
npm run build
```

and pointing your web server to the generated `index.html` file found at `dist/index.html`.

### Continuous Integration

##### TODO

## Devtools

This project includes a set of Devtools. Some are additional package dependencies whereas others come built-in to the packages themselves.

### Devtool dependencies:

- [@tanstack/react-query-devtools](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/devtools) - Dedicated dev tools to help visualize the inner workings of React Query
- [@tanstack/router-devtools](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/devtools) - Dedicated dev tools to help visualize the inner workings of TanStack Router
- [@tanstack/react-table-devtools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-table-devtools) - Dedicated dev tools to help visualize the inner workings of TanStack Table
- [@hookform/DevTools](https://react-hook-form.com/dev-tools) - React Hook Form Devtools to help debug forms with validation

A set of utility components are provided in `src/components/utils/development-tools/`. These [wrapper components](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/devtools#only-importing-and-using-devtools-in-developmentgit) check whether the application is running in development or production mode and render the component or null respectively. In other words, you can confidently use them during development without having to worry about them showing up for end users in production.

**TanStack Router Devtools**, however, utilizes its respective utility component in this project. The initial setup has been taken care of but if you wish to modify or remove the component, have a look in `src/App.tsx`.

The TanStack Router Devtools icon can be found in the bottom right corner of the page denoted by the vertically stacked "TANSTACK ROUTER" logo.

The above components, along with their imports, are commented out to start.

**TanStack Table Devtools** Documentation is, at the time of writing this, non-existent. Having said that, usage is similar to the other TanStack devtools. A utility component restricting the devtools to development builds has been provided. The difference in comparison to the other TanStack devtools is the lack of floating mode. Instead, the Devtools are rendered as a component within the actual TanStack Table you define. An additional caveat being that the DevTools component (built-in and provided utility alike) require a table prop from the `useReactTable()` hook. In other words, if you have multiple tables, each table must have its own Devtools component. Check the simplified code below.

```
function Table(): FunctionComponent {
  /* some code */

  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  });

  return (
    <>
      {/* table code */}
      <TanStackTableDevelopmentTools table={table} />
    </>
  )
}
```

**React Hook Form DevTools** icon can be recognized in the top right corner of the page by the pink React Hook Form clipboard logo. A utility component has also provided. Like the TanStack Table Devtools component above, a prop must be passed from a specific hook. In this case, it is the control prop from the `useForm()` hook. Similar to TanStack Table, use of React Hook Form DevTools requires the component be added to each unique form. More information can be found in the [React Hook Form DevTools documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/dev-tools).

To reiterate, if you wish to restrict the Devtools to development builds use the provided components found at `src/components/utils/development-tools` instead of the built-in components from their respective modules.
